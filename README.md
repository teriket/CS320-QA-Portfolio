    How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure?

Ensuring my code is functional and secure is done in parallel to writing the code.  The design of the code is first checked for errors in logic.  Then tests are written to validate a user story and code is written to pass this test.  This cycle of iterations continues until the program meets the users requirements.
    
    How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?

I interpret user needs by identifying types of users -- usually in user personas -- and describing their goals from using an application. These goals can be described as user stories, succinct action statements that describe a function of an application. These user stories act as a guide for program implementation.
    
    How do I approach designing software?

I develop programs using Agile practices to balance uncertainty. At the start of a program I set the general direction for development and make concrete plans for core features. As development continues, I will iterate over the project to implement new features and possibly change the direction of development.
